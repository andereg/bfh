This extension stores your Moodle login credentials (username and password) only locally in your browser. No data is transmitted to any external servers, shared with third parties, or used for analytics or tracking.

The sole purpose of this extension is to simplify the login process to the BFH Moodle platform by automatically filling in the saved credentials on the login page.

You can update or delete your stored credentials at any time through the extension interface.
This extension fully complies with Chrome Web Store policies and does not collect any personal data beyond what is explicitly saved by the user.

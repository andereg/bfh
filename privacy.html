We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how the BFH Moodle Faster Login Extension interacts with your data and the steps we take to protect your personal information.

1. Data Controller
The data controller for processing your data in connection with the BFH Moodle Faster Login Extension is:

[Your Name/Company]

[Your Address]

[Your Email Address]

2. Types of Data Processed
The BFH Moodle Faster Login Extension does not store or process any personal data itself. However, it interacts with certain data on the login forms of specific websites, as follows:

Autofill of Login Credentials: The extension interacts with the login form fields (username and password) on websites like moodle.bfh.ch and login.eduid.ch to autofill the saved credentials stored in Chrome's Password Manager. This allows for a faster login experience.

Interaction with Form Fields: The extension modifies the attributes of the username and password fields (e.g., setting the autocomplete attribute) to ensure that Chrome’s Password Manager is properly triggered to autofill the credentials.

3. Purpose of Data Usage
The data is used exclusively for the following purposes:

Autofilling Login Forms: The extension utilizes the saved credentials from Chrome’s Password Manager (username and password) to autofill the login form fields on specific login pages like moodle.bfh.ch and login.eduid.ch.

Automated Login: The extension also simulates the user clicking the submit or proceed buttons after the fields are autofilled, automating the login process.

4. Data Storage
The BFH Moodle Faster Login Extension does not store any personal data such as usernames, passwords, or login credentials. All credentials are securely stored and managed by Chrome's Password Manager. The extension merely accesses and autofills the data into the login forms when necessary.

5. Use of Chrome’s Password Manager
The extension relies on Chrome's Password Manager for storing and retrieving login credentials. Chrome securely stores the user’s credentials locally on their device and ensures they are encrypted. The extension does not have access to the actual credentials; it simply fills in the forms based on the autofill data stored in Chrome.

6. Permissions and Access
The extension requests the activeTab and host_permissions permissions in order to interact with specific websites:

activeTab: This permission allows the extension to interact with the currently active webpage, but only when the user has triggered the extension (e.g., by clicking the extension icon).

host_permissions: This permission enables the extension to access and fill in login forms on the specific websites, moodle.bfh.ch and login.eduid.ch, ensuring that the extension only works on these intended sites.

7. No Tracking of User Data
The extension does not track any user data or activity. It only interacts with the login forms on the specified websites and does not collect any personal information or browsing history. No data is sent to external servers, and no user data is shared with third parties.

8. Security
The extension takes no direct action to store, share, or transmit user data. All data handling is managed securely by Chrome's Password Manager. The credentials used by the extension are encrypted and securely stored by Chrome on the user's device, and only the user has access to these credentials.

9. Changes to the Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be communicated via the extension or by updating this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.
